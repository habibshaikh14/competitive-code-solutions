# competitive-code-solutions
The purpose of this project is to create a common space for submitting solutions for various competitive coding probles.

The main branch is used to keep track of the problems that are being solved.
Once a solution is submitted the thinking process is documented and uploaded in the main branch.

Every child branch will contain an info file which will give us an idea about the tech stack used for finding the solution.

Please make sure to add as many comments as you can to help others understand your approach.
